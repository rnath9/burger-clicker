# Burger Clicker (OCaml)

This project was created as a final project for CS 3110 — Functional Programming and Data Structures. Inspired by Cookie Clicker (https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/), we implemented our own version, with burgers and OCaml.

# How it works:
In this interactive game, the player's goal is to generate as many burgers as possible. The player starts by manually clicking on a burger until they can finally buy "buildings" that auto-generate burgers as well (contributing to their burgers per second count). There are also random events, that appear in the form of golden, clickable burgers. Upon clicking a golden burger, one of two events may trigger — a random powerup, such as boosting a player's clicks per second or burgers per second by a random multiplier for about 10-40 seconds, or just a fun, sarcastic message may appear on screen.

# Installation:
